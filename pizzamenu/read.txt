**********************
MY first project in react 
creating all using components 
header component 
menu component 
footer component


************************************
before we had one file for html and 1 file for css and 1 file for javascript

as file become more interactive web page started becomeing single page application 

react component is one component per file compared to traditional one technology per file .

react component has html and css and javascript

***************************************

props are used to transfer data from parent components to child components

props are essential tools to configure and custiomize the react component(like function parameters)

props help that parent components can control what child components shuld be like 

Anything can be passesd in props single values arrays , objects functions and even other components
******************************************************************************

Props are immutable 

if u need to mutate props you actually need state 

React uses one way data flow means that in react application data can oly from parent to child and never the opposite way not the opposite way unlike angular which uses the two way data flow 

this makes application more prdectiable and easier to understand

It is more performant 

Makes application easier to debug 
as we have more control over the data

******************************************************************************

Rules of JSX
JSX works essentially like Html but we can enter javascript mode by using {}

statements are not allowed in JSX(if/else,for,switch)

JSX produces javascript expression
const el = <h1>Hello world </h1>;
is same as
const el= React.createElement("h1",null,"Hello world");

note 
1> WE can place other peices of JSX in {}
2> We can write JSX anywhere inside the component 
3> A peice of JSX can only have one root element . IF you want more , use <React.fragment></React.fragment> or the short <></>
